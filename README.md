# About Batsh

Batsh is a simple programming language that compiles to [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Windows Batch](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/batch.mspx).
It enables you to write your script once runs on all platforms without **any** additional dependency.

Both Bash and Batch are messy to read and tricky to write due to historical reasons.
You have to spend a lot of time learning either of them and write platform-dependent code for each operating system.
I have wasted lots of time in my life struggling with bizarre syntaxes and unreasonable behaviors of them, and do not want to waste any more.

If you happen to be a maintainer of a cross-platform tool which relies on Bash on Linux/Mac and Batch on Windows as "glue code", and found it painful to "synchronize" between them, you would definitely like to try Batsh.
